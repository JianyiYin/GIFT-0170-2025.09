1.The three pathfinder files can be functioned to play pygames.

2.The three algorithms have been already finished, and you can write other algorithms.You just need to alter one line in the pathfinder file.

3.How to use pygame on SJTU HPC?
Firstly, download MobaXterm(if it is tortured to wait, use free download manager).
Then, create SSH connection to your HPC account.
After that, ask for computing nodes and simply start X11 by tapping this:salloc -p cpu -N 1 -n 1.
Finally, you are expected to enter a computing node which is though not eager to open x11(because srun is not compatable with x11, so you have to manually use SSH to open x11), 
and you can tap ssh -X cas024(which means your node name) to correctly connect to x11. 
Congratulations! You can show your pygame page on MobaXterm and other similar X servers!
